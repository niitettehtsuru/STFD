## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### How the game is played

The player is the green square.<br>
Player can jump up to 3 blocks high.<br>
A level is complete if player is completely inside the door(on the right edge of the screen).<br>
The player gets an extra life after collecting 100 coins.<br> 
Player dies if player collides with bugs(red squares),red balls, 
saws(jagged edges at the bottom), lava spit or dripping hot lava.<br>

1. Navigate using the arrow keys.<br> 
* Left arrow key to go left. 
* Right arrow key to go right. 
* Up arrow key to jump. 
* Down arrow key to descend. 
2. Shoot to kill a red square(bug) by pressing the space bar.<br>
3. Drop a bomb to destroy some blocks by pressing the "B" key.<br>
NB: This is useful if the player is trapped. You can only drop 4 bombs per level. Hence use bombs wisely.<br>
AND, a bomb can't kill you.<br>
